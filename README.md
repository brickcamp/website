**BrickCamp** is a visual dictionary for LEGO`速` building techniques.

## Foundation

BrickCamp is only possible because of some amazing projects and technologies out there. This project is based on:

- [Grav](https://getgrav.org/): An amazing flat-file open-source content management system
- [Twig Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/): An easy-to-learn templating engine used by Grav
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): A simple markup language for formatting text
- [YAML](http://yaml.org/): One more markup language, this time for configuration and metadata
- [LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org/): An open standard for LEGO`速` 3D modelling
- [LeoCAD](https://www.leocad.org/): A CAD programm based on the LDraw standard
- [Rebrickable.com](https://rebrickable.com/): A LEGO`速` creations platform with open-accesible data/images
- [GitLab](http://gitlab.com/): The source-code versioning platform where this project started

A huge thanks to each and every one of these projects and their supporting communities.
