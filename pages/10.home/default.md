## This site is a work-in-progress

It's replacing a part of [my current website](https://brickup.de) that lately stopped working. 

The goal is to develop an open-source copyleft collection of popular and interesting Lego building techniques.

## Feel free to [explore](/techs/explore)

Have a look around. There is still so much to do, so don't worry if some errors occur or something's missing. 

My brain is idea-overflowing while making things useable that are already implemented. Oh what an exciting time! Stay tuned - hope to officially launch this site soon.

**Greetings**
