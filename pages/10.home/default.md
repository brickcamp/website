**This site is a work-in-progress** replacing a part of [my current website](https://brickup.de) that lately stopped working. The goal is to develop an open-source freely-usable simply-searchable collection of popular and interesting Lego building techniques. 

Please feel free to [browse around](/techs/explore) and have some fun. There is still so much to do, so don't worry if some errors occur or something's missing. My brain is idea-overflowing while making things useable that are already implemented. Oh what an exciting time! Stay tuned - hope to officially launch this site soon.

**Greetings**
