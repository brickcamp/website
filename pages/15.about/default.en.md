BrickCamp aims to be an **easy-to-use, open and secure** online tool to help LEGOÂ® builders accomplish their goals. Currently, it is still under heavy development by [Tobias Buckdahn](https://www.brickup.de/?target=_blank&rel=noopener).

### Easy-to-use

For beginners and newcomers, some community terms (like [SNOT, AZMEP, etc.](https://www.brothers-brick.com/lego-glossary/?target=_blank&rel=noopener)) might be confusing. That's why BrickCamp structures its entries purely by (unabbreviated) purpose:

 - [Rotations](/techs/rotations) to change the orientation of a piece.
 - [Offsets](/techs/offsets) to get independent of the stud grid.
 - [Patterns](/techs/patterns) to decorate surfaces.
 - [Shapes](/techs/shapes) to help with some geometries.

And there's more on the horizont - stay curious.

### Free and Open
